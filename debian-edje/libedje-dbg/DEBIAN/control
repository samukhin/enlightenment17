Description: Debugging symbols for libedje
 Edje is a graphical layout and animation library for animated resizable,
 compressed and scalable themes. It is the theming engine behind
 Enlightenment DR 0.17.
 .
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat
 easier to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in
 /usr/lib/debug and are automatically used by gdb.
