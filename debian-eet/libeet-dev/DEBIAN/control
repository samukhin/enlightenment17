Description: Enlightenment DR17 file chunk reading/writing library development files
 Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of data to a
 file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allows
 fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as zip
 itself has more complexity than needed, and it was much simpler to implement
 this once here.
 .
 This package contains headers and static libraries for development with libeet.
