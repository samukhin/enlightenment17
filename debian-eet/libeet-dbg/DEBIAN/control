Description: E17 file chunk reading/writing library - debug symbols
 Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of data to a
 file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allows
 fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as zip
 itself has more complexity than needed, and it was much simpler to implement
 this once here
 .
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier
 to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in /usr/lib/debug and
 are automatically used by gdb.
