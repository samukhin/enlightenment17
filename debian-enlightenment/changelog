  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0
  * patch 01_install_internal-use_binaries_in_usr_lib_enlightenment.diff :
    - actually introduced in the initial revision, installs some binaries which
     are only for internal use in usr/lib/enligthenment instead of /usr/bin
  * Bump B-D on debhelper to 6.0.7 to be sure to get dh_lintian
  * Fix typo in README.Debian. (Closes: #495185)
